    <p>I trust you all caught �The Red Dragon and the Gold,� the fourth episode of season 2 of H<em>OUSE OF THE
            DRAGON</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of you have been wanting for action, I know; this episode delivered it in
        spades with the Battle of Rook�s Rest, when dragon met dragon in the skies.</p>
    <p>Has there ever been a dragon battle to match it? &nbsp; I seem to recall that <em>REIGN OF FIRE</em> had a few
        scenes where a dozen dragons were wheeling through the skies. &nbsp; So, okay, maybe that was a
        <strong><em>bigger</em></strong> scene, with more dragons on screen� but a <em><strong>better</strong></em>
        battle?&nbsp;&nbsp; I don�t think so.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our guys knocked this one out of the castle.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
        think they took it as a challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the dragons�</p>
    <p>Dragons are mythical, of course.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the real world, the one we live in as opposed to those we like to
        read about� dragons never existed� though similar creatures can be found in legends all around the
        world.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some believe that maybe the stories were inspired by the discovery of dinosaur bones by
        farmers plowing their fields.&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of where the stories originated, they have been a huge part
        of fantasy for centuries.&nbsp; And I�ve been fond of them for as long as I remember.</p>
    <p>Hell, I�m <i>named</i> after a dragonslayer � St. George, of course �&nbsp; and he�s still a saint, when a lot of
        other saints were thrown out a couple decades back� which I suppose means that dragons have papal
        approval.&nbsp;&nbsp; I started writing my own dragon tales long before <em>A GAME OF THRONES.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        �The Ice Dragon� and&nbsp; �The Way of Cross and Dragon� were two of my best.</p>
    <p>Every culture has its own version of dragons; Chinese dragons are wingless and do not breathe fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        They bring good luck.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traditional western dragons bring mostly fire and death� but modern
        fantasists have played with that a lot too.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dragons of<em> ERAGON</em> and <em>HOW TO TRAIN YOUR
            DRAGON</em> are very different from mine own.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Toothless is even cute).</p>

    <p>Tolkien�s dragons were always evil, servants of Morgoth and Sauron.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were akin to his orcs and
        trolls.&nbsp;&nbsp; JRRT did not do friendly dragons.&nbsp;&nbsp; His dragons were intelligent,
        though.&nbsp;&nbsp; Smaug <em>talks</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; He also has a huge horde of gold, a very traditional
        dragon trait� and he sleeps on his treasure, for months and years at a time.</p>

    <p>Before Peter Jackson�s Smaug, the best dragon ever seen on film was Vermithrax Pejorative in
        <em>DRAGONSLAYER</em><b><i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b> Two legs and two wings, dangerous, fire-breathing, a
        flyer, does not talk, does not horde gold.&nbsp;&nbsp; An inspiration for all dragonlovers.</p>

    <p>At the other end of the scale is the dragon in <b><i>DRAGONHEART</i></b> (voice by Sean Connery).&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Fat, four-legged, talking, a good guy who befriends the hero.&nbsp;&nbsp; A much inferior dragon in a much
        inferior film.&nbsp; Bah.</p>

    <p>In <em>A SONG OF ICE &amp; FIRE,</em> I set out to blend the wonder of epic fantasy with the grittiness of the
        best historical fiction.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is magic in my world, yes� but much less of it than one gets in most
        fantasy.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Tolkien�s Middle Earth was relatively low magic too, and I took my cue from the
        master).&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted Westeros to feel <em>real</em>, to evoke the Crusades and the Hundred Years War
        and the Wars of the Roses as much as it did JRRT with his hobbits and magic rings.</p>
    <p>I would have dragons, yes� in part because of my dear friend, the late Phyllis Eisenstein, a marvelous fantasist
        and science fiction writer in her own right, now sadly missed�&nbsp; but I wanted my dragons to be as real and
        believable as such a creature could ever be.&nbsp;&nbsp; I designed my dragons with a lot of care.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        They fly and breathe fire, yes, those traits seemed essential to me.&nbsp; They have<strong><em>
                two</em></strong> legs (not four, never four) and two wings.<br><em>LARGE</em> wings.&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot
        of fantasy dragons have these itty bitty wings that would never get such a creature off the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <strong>And only two legs; the wings are the forelegs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Four-legged dragons exist only in
        heraldry.&nbsp;&nbsp; No animal that has ever lived on Earth has six limbs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Birds have two legs and
        two wings, bats the same, ditto pteranodons and other flying dinosaurs, etc.</p>
    <p>Much&nbsp; of the confusion about the proper&nbsp; number of legs on a dragon has its roots in medieval
        heraldry.&nbsp; In the beginning both versions could be seen on shields and banners, but over the centuries, as
        heraldry became more standardized, the heralds took to calling the four-legged beasties
        <strong><em>dragon</em></strong>s and their two-legged kin <strong><em>wyverns</em></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; No one
        had ever&nbsp;<em> seen</em> a dragon or a wyvern, of course; neither creature actually existed save in legend,
        so there was a certain arbitrary quality to this distinction� and medieval heralds were not exactly renowned for
        their grasp of zoology, even for real world animals.&nbsp; Just take a look at what they thought a seahorse
        looked like.</p>
    <p>Dragons <em><strong>DO</strong></em> exist in the world of Westeros, however (wyverns too, down in Sothoryos), so
        my own heralds did not have that excuse.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ergo, in my books, the Targaryen sigil has two legs, as it
        should.&nbsp; Why would any Westerosi ever put four legs on a dragon, when they could look at the real thing and
        could their limbs?&nbsp;&nbsp; My wyverns have two legs as well; they differ from the dragons of my world
        chiefly in size, coloration, and the inability to breath fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (It should be stressed that
        while the Targaryen sigil has the proper number of legs (two), it is not exactly anatomically
        correct.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wings are way too small compared to the body, and of course no dragon has three
        heads.&nbsp;&nbsp; That bit is purely symbolic, meant to reflect Aegon the Conqueror and his two sisters).</p>
    <p>FWIW, the shows got it half right (both of them).&nbsp;&nbsp; GAME OF THRONES gave us the correct two-legged
        sigils for the first four seasons and most of the fifth, but when Dany�s fleet hove into view, all the sails
        showed four-legged dragons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone got sloppy, I guess.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or someone opened a book on
        heraldry, and read just enough of it to muck it all up.&nbsp;&nbsp; A little knowledge is a dangerous
        thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple years on, HOUSE OF THE DRAGON decided the heraldry should be consistent with GAME OF
        THRONES.. but they went with the bad sigil rather than the good one.&nbsp;&nbsp; That sound you heard was me
        screaming, �no, no, no.�&nbsp;&nbsp; Those damned extra legs have even wormed their way onto the covers of my
        books, over my strenuous objections.</p>

    <p>Valyrian dragons differ in other ways from the likes of Smaug and Toothless and Vermithrax as well.</p>
    <p>My dragons do not talk.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are relatively intelligent, but they are still beasts.</p>
    <p>They bond with men� some men� and the why and how of that, and how it came to be, will eventually be revealed in
        more detail in <em>THE WINDS OF WINTER</em> and <em>A DREAM OF SPRING</em> and some in <em>BLOOD &amp;
            FIRE</em>.&nbsp; (Septon Barth got much of it right).&nbsp;&nbsp; Like wolves and bears and lions, dragons
        can be trained, but never entirely tamed.&nbsp;&nbsp; They will always be dangerous.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some are wilder
        and more wilful than others.&nbsp; They are individuals, they have personalities� and they often reflect the
        personalities of their riders, thanks to bond they share are. &nbsp;&nbsp; They do not care a whit about gold or
        gems, no more than a tiger would.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless maybe their rider was obsessed with the shiny stuff, and
        even then�</p>
    <p>Dragons need food.&nbsp;&nbsp; They need water too, but they have no gills.&nbsp; They need to breathe .&nbsp;
        Some say that&nbsp; Smaug slept for sixty years below the Lonely Mountains before Bilbo and the dwarves woke him
        up.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dragons born of Valyria cannot do that.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are creatures of fire, and fire
        needs oxygen.&nbsp;&nbsp; A dragon could dip into the ocean to scoop up a fish, perhaps, but they�d fly right up
        again.&nbsp; If held underwater too long, they would drown, just like any other land animal.</p>
    <p>My dragons are predators, carnivores who like their meat will done.&nbsp;&nbsp; They can and will hunt their own
        prey, but they are also territorial.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have lairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; As creatures of the sky, they like
        mountain tops, and volcanic mountains best of all.&nbsp; These are creatures of fire, and the cold dank caverns
        that other fantasists house their pets in are not for mine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man-made dwellings, like the
        stables of Dragonstone, the&nbsp; towers tops of the Valryian Freehold, and the Dragonpit of King�s Landing, are
        acceptable � and often come with men bringing them food.&nbsp; If those are not available, young dragons will
        find their own lairs� and defend them fiercely.</p>
    <p>My dragons are creatures of the sky.&nbsp;&nbsp; They fly, and can cross mountains and plains, cover hundreds of
        miles� but they don�t, unless their riders take them there.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are&nbsp; not nomadic.&nbsp; During
        the heyday of Valyria there were forty dragon-riding families with hundreds of dragons amongst them� but (aside
        from our Targaryens) all of them stayed close to the Freehold and the Lands of the Long Summer.&nbsp; From time
        to time a dragonrider might visit Volantis or another Valyrian colony, even settle there for a few years, but
        never permanently.&nbsp; Think about it. &nbsp; If dragons were nomadic, they would have overrun half of Essos,
        and the Doom would only have killed a few of them. &nbsp; Similarly, the dragons of Westeros seldom wander far
        from Dragonstone. &nbsp; Elsewise, after three hundred years, we would have dragons all over the realm and every
        noble house would have a few. &nbsp; The three wild dragons mentioned in <b><i>Fire &amp; Blood</i></b> have
        lairs on Dragonstone.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest can be found in the Dragonpit of King�s Landing, or in deep caverns
        under the Dragonmont.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luke flies Arrax to Storm�s End and Jace to Winterfell, yes, but the
        dragons would not have flown there on their own, save under very special circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp; You won�t
        find dragons hunting the riverlands or the Reach or the Vale, or roaming the northlands or the mountains of
        Dorne.</p>
    <p>Fantasy needs to be grounded.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not simply a license to do anything you like.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Smaug and Toothless may both be dragons, but they should never be confused.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ignore canon, and the
        world you�ve created comes apart like tissue paper.</p>
